Release history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Git-Check-Remote

0.2.0 2013-11-23T05:50:23Z
 [00 Major Changes]
 - Serious code overhauls contained, and may break dependendents.

 [01 Role Refactor]
 - This code has been in development for a while, mostly because I had
   trouble deciding how to implement it.
 - Couldn't choose between vertically-composed roles, or
   horizontally-composed roles, and the git history switches between the
   two several times.
 - Settled on the horizonal, mostly, because there were other things using
   these roles, and vertical composition would break them severely.
 - And vertical composition would force the roles to only work on DZil
   plugins, where there are consumers using them on DZ::App::Commands
 - ::Git::Remote is gone in this release, and replaced by ::Git::RemoteName
   and ::Git::RemoteNames
